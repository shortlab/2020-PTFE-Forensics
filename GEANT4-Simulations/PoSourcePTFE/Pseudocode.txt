Pseudocode

OPTION 1:


while k < 1
	increment dimension
	initialize flux throughout dimension with 1,000,000 of incident particles at randomly selected positions and 1 MeV
		record positions of fissions, directions, and energies
	record number of fissions = currentGenNeutrons
	for 1:100 (to allow the flux distribution to reach a steady state)
		record the previous fissio parameters
		zero out the previous fission parameters
		run at each of those fissions
			record positions of fissions, directions, energies
		prevGen = currentGen
		currentGen = count of text file

	k = currentGen/prevGen





	Geometry nesting


  // Assembly =     Box =       17*rodDiameter x 17*rodDiameter x rodHeight
  // RodBox =       Box =       rodDiameter x 17*rodDiameter x rodHeight === replicated along the x axis
  // Rod =          Cylinder =  rodDiameter x rodHeight
  // Cladding =     Cylinder =  thickness-rodDiameter x rodHeight
  // Fuel =         Cylinder =  pelletDiameter x rodHeight




OPTION 2:
while moderatorDensity < 1.2
	for each of the initial neutrons
      		Shoot randomly amid volume, let go for NUMGEN generations, record locations of fissions and write to file
    count number of fissions that occurred == number of neutrons produced == currentGenNeutrons
    calculate k resulting from that == initialK
    if initialK < 1.2
     	read in the written positions
     	clear out the fission file
     	run with the written positions, it will go for NUMGEN generations again and write results to file
     	set prevGenNeutrons = currentGenNeutrons
     	count number of neutrons created (size of file)
     	calculate k and print it
